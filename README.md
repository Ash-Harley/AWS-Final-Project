Goal was to Plan, Design and Develop conceptual, logical, and physical data model to achieve the ultimate warehouse solution i.e., a data warehouse.

To analyze the motor vehicle crashes and violation codes data, and identify the most common code of violations, reasons for violations, and distribution of violations over the months and days of the week to improve traffic safety in the city.

• Analyzed NYC traffic violation data on AWS, identifying common violations and distribution patterns. 

• Built a scalable data warehouse on AWS, integrating structured and semi/unstructured datasets for improved analysis. 

• Implemented data migration from S3 to Redshift and Redshift to RDS using AWS Glue, Databrew, and Lambda functions, optimizing data flow for Tableau visualization. 

• Resolved data quality and representativeness challenges, ensuring accurate insights for traffic safety improvements.
